# drg-reduction
DRG source code for mechanism reduction, creating skeletal mechanism to combustion simulations. \
Devloped by: Felipe C. Minuzzi \
Summer/2017


This code uses two types of simulation for DRG reduction: reactor, to calculate ignition time, and 1D premixed flame, for flamespeed. \
The configuration is set in the 'input' file.
